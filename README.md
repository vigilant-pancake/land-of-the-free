# Land of the Free Project
In the past couple weeks many governement websites have been sensored or restricted, with information being removed or changed. This project is to maintain access to useful information for anyone who may need it working through as many sites as can be found using sites such as [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/) to track changes, look at what had been there as of a certain data and in some cases adding more detail when possible. Using different sources to track changes as soon as possible, such as [news articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/upshot/trump-government-websites-missing-pages.html) and social media, will help to build the resources.
